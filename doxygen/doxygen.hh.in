/**
 * \page PageNotation Notational conventions
 *
 * Throughout this reference documentation we use some notational conventions
 * designed to keep the documentation concise yet understandable. Please
 * read the following carefully.
 *
 * \section NotationArray Array notation
 *
 * We allow ourselves to refer to the \f$i\f$-th element of an array \f$x\f$ 
 * by \f$x_i\f$. The size of an array \f$x\f$ (either provided by a member 
 * function \c %size() or clear from context) is denoted \f$|x|\f$.
 *
 * \section NotationHome The home space
 *
 * Many functions and member functions take an argument \a home of 
 * type \c Space&. The home space serves as manager to many
 * operations used by variables, views, propagators, spaces, and so
 * on. It provides
 * services such as failure management, propagation control, 
 * memory management, and so on. To keep the documentation concise
 * the home space is not documented for functions
 * and member functions.
 *
 * \section NotationShare Sharing in update and copy
 *
 * In member functions that either copy or update an object during
 * cloning, an argument \a share of type \c bool is available. This
 * Boolean value controls whether during cloning the data structure at
 * hand will be shared among the newly created cloned space and the original
 * or whether two independent copies are created. Some functions (such
 * as \c copy for spaces (Gecode::Space) or \c copy for propagators
 * (Gecode::Propagator) also feature this argument. Here it is used
 * to pass on the Boolean value to other datastructures used inside spaces
 * or propagators.
 *
 * The actual value the \a share argument has is defined by the search
 * engine: when a search engine uses the \a clone member function of
 * a space it decides whether sharing is to be used in the cloning of
 * the space or not. If the search engine is single-threaded, it will
 * use full sharing (\a share will be true). Only if the search engine
 * uses concurrency or parallelism with more than a single thread,
 * it will pass false as value. This means that by not sharing data structures
 * among spaces which are to be used in different threads, all parts of
 * %Gecode but the actual search engine do not need to provide concurrency
 * control.
 *
 * As examples for data structures which are sensitive to sharing, consider
 * Gecode::SharedArray, Gecode::IntSet, and Gecode::DFA.

/**
 * \page PageHowToChange_2 How to Change from %Gecode 1.3.1 to %Gecode 2.0.x
 *

As %Gecode 2.0.0 is a major revision of %Gecode, your programs that are written
for %Gecode 1.3.1 are likely to require some modifications before they work
again. All modifications are straightforward, though.

This short summary shows how to adapt your models and linker invocation, for
changes to propagator implementations, etc, please consult the changelog.

\section SecChange2IntBool IntVar and BoolVar

Boolean variables (BoolVar) are not any longer integer variables
(IntVar). The same holds for variable arrays (BoolVarArray,
IntVarArray). So, you can not mix Boolean and integer variables
in the same array (use two different arrays) and you can not cast
between them. If you want to link the value of a BoolVar to the
value of an IntVar you have to use a \ref TaskModelIntChannel
"channel constraint".  Posting constraints remains unchanged, as
all constraints offer two overloaded versions (one for IntVar,
one for BoolVar).

\section SecChange2Regular Regular constraint

The regular constraint has been renamed to extensional (after
all, it is an extensionally specified constraint). The old name
is still available in the MiniModel module. 

If you want to use regular expressions, you have to add
   \code #include <gecode/int/minimodel.hh> \endcode
to your file as they moved to the MiniModel module.

\section SecChange2Bool Boolean constraints

In order to make the interface to Boolean constraints more
regular and similar to set constraints, Boolean constraints are
available as rel constraints. That is, instead of
   \code bool_and(home, x, y, z); \endcode
you have to write
   \code rel(home, x, BOT_AND, y, z); \endcode
Likewise, for arrays you have to write
   \code rel(home, BOT_AND, x, y); \endcode
instead of
   \code bool_and(home, x, y); \endcode
More information is available \ref TaskModelIntRelBool "here".

\section SecChange2Branching Branching

Values and types for selecting how to branch have been made uniform. 
Replace BVAL_* by INT_VAL_*, BVAR_* by INT_VAR_*, and so on.

\section SecChange2GCC Global cardinality constraint

The interface for the global cardinality constraint has been
simplified.  The constraint is now called count. Please check the
documentation for \ref TaskModelIntCount "details".

\section SecChange2Sorted Sortedness constraint

The sortedness constraint has been renamed to sorted.

\section SecChange2Linking Linking

Some generic functionality has been put into its own library (\code
libgecodesupport \endcode on Unix systems, \code GecodeSupport.dll \endcode on
Windows). You have to link against this library now.

*/

/**
 * \page PageHowToChange_3 How to Change from %Gecode 2.2.2 to %Gecode 3.0.0
 *

As %Gecode 3.0.0 is a major revision, your programs that
are written for %Gecode 2.2.2 are likely to require some
modifications before they work again. All modifications are
straightforward, though.

This short summary shows how to adapt your models, for changes to
propagator implementations, etc, please consult the changelog.

\section SecChange3Param Passing parameters

Now everything is passed as reference (Space, Propagator,
ModEventDelta, Advisor, Branching, and BranchingDesc). 

The reason for this massive change is to be more C++ compliant
and make the interfaces more consistent (at some places things were passed as
references and at other places as pointers, for no obvious and
explainable reason). Routines that create objects rather than
pass them (such as copy, clone, or description) still return a
pointer to an object (so that it can actually be deleted!).

You will have to rewrite your models and other programs using
%Gecode. For models this is easy enough:
 - Replace "(Space* home" by "(Space& home".
 - Replace "home->" by "home.".
 - Replace "(this" by "(*this".
 .
That should do the trick for 99% of the models.

For the other changes, just lookout for the changes in types and
that "this" becomes "*this" now.


\section SecChange3Set Set constrains

Element and convexity constraints on set variables have a more
uniform interface, and the match constrained has been renamed to
channel.

The values for variable and value selection for branching have
been made consistent and extended. 
The following values have been renamed:
 - SET_VAR_MIN_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MIN
 - SET_VAR_MAX_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MAX
 - SET_VAR_MIN_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MIN_MIN
 - SET_VAR_MAX_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MAX_MAX
 - SET_VAL_MIN -> SET_VAL_MIN_INC
 - SET_VAL_MAX -> SET_VAL_MAX_INC
 .
Tie-breaking and random selection is now supported.

\section SecChange3Files Naming scheme for files

All files with extension .cc have been renamed to .cpp, and .icc
has become .hpp. This avoids conflicts as .icc is typically used
for other file types. All include directives are now specified
using <...> notation instead of "...", so that %Gecode headers do
not clutter the include namespace of a client program.

\section SecChange3 Constrain method for best solution search

The constrain method used for best solution search must be
virtual and takes an argument of type const Space& rather than
Space* as argument.
