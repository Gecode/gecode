[RELEASE]
Version:	2.0.0
Date:		unknown
[DESCRIPTION]
The best Gecode ever... Done with supernatural powers!

[ENTRY]
Module: bdd
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Finite integer set variables based on binary decision diagrams
(BDDs) have been added as a new variable type.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
A reflection API has been added, which allows to query spaces 
about the variables and propagators they contain.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   bug
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branching ids were not properly initialized. This was a serious problem if you 
posted branchings in spaces other than the root space.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Iterator-based domain operations have been renamed,
reimplemented, and extended. Now operations for both range and
value iterators are supported and the operations can be told to
perform more efficient destructive updates.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
VarArrays can now be resized dynamically.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Boolean linear equations and inequalities with constant
right-hand sides use constant time propagators whenever
appropriate (linear time with less overhead and memory for
propagators with few variables).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added advisors as an abstraction for incremental propagation:
advisors are executed for their propagator whenever their view
changes. Advisors, when not being used, add one word of overhead
to each variable and slow down the system in the worst case by
less than 5%. In average, no slowdown can be observed.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a border-case bug for n-ary Boolean conjunction and disjunction.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
A new propagation condition PC_GEN_NONE (and hence, PC_INT_NONE,
...) has been introduced. Propagator patterns with this
propagation condition now do not create any subscriptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The regular constraint has been reimplemented, the new version
runs more than twice as fast.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a model for the travelling salesman problem, mostly
intended to exercise the new circuit constraint (as the model is not
very competitive).

[ENTRY]
Module:	kernel
What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Support for reference-counted shared objects added: they handle
both reference counting as well as non-shared copying. This fixes
some bugs with the handling os shared arrays, integer sets, and
finite automata.


[ENTRY]
Module:	example
What:	bug
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Examples reported wrong number of propagator invocations (the
invocations for problem setup were missing).

[ENTRY]
Module:	kernel
What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added classes for shared objects and handles. Handles to shared
objects allow to either share copies among spaces when being
copied or to create a new shared copy, if requested.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	new
Rank:	minor
Thanks:	Martin Mann
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a new version of count (and also atleast, atmost, exactly)
that counts the number of variables equal to integers in an
array.

[ENTRY]
Module:	example
What:	bug
Rank:	minor
Bug:	50
[DESCRIPTION]
The number of colors in graph-color was off by one.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added channel constraints that channel an integer variable to
either a single or an array of Boolean variables.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	bug
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed bug in copying of n-ary or-propagator for a special boundary case.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	new
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Relaxed sharing restrictions for channel, in particular 
channel(this, x, x) is allowed.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added propagators for the circuit constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module:	kernel
What:	performance
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Improved automatic memory management on Windows platforms.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	performance
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Domain consistent distinct and channel allocate memory from the
space heap now. Much simpler.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The Boolean tell operations one_none and zero_none now also
return a ModEvent and hence must be checked for failure. This is
needed for simpler advisors.

[ENTRY]
Module:	kernel
What:	performance
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
The memory management policies have been completely reworked. Now
memory requests are much more regular. Hence, memory is much more
likely to be returned to the operating system. Furthermore, the
flush member functions for actors have been removed (they were
unneeded) and actors and spaces now have allocated member
functions for returning how much memory is allocated by a space.

Moreover, the memory reported by some propagators has been
ingnored. Note that this flaw did not affect the bechmark figures
on the %Gecode webpage.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	performance
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The multiplication uses integer precision if possible for better
performance.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Integer and Boolean variables are now guaranteed to be
inspectable (that is, all const member functions work on them),
even though a space is failed. However, the variables might have
been modified during a tell operation that has failed.

[ENTRY]
Module:	minimodel
What:	change
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Linear expressions and relations can also be created from Boolean
variables, with the restriction that Boolean relations cannot be
reified.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	change
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Boolean variables (and hence Boolean views) do not any longer
share the implementation with integer variables. That has the
following consequences:
- Boolean variables are not any longer integer variables. The same
  holds true for arrays of variables.
- All constraints that make sense for both Boolean and integer
  variables have post functions that support both integer and
  Boolean variables.
- Memory for Boolean variables is reduced by 50% and performance
  increases in problems with many Boolean variables by up to 50%.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added propagators for linear constraints over Boolean variables,
in particular specialized and efficient versions for non-unit
coefficients.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The linear constraints are now more careful (that is, they will
use more efficient versions more often if it is safe) to
determine whether overflow occurs and which precision (integer or
double) should be chosen.

[ENTRY]
Module:	int
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The element constraints now accept an additional offset argument.

[ENTRY]
Module:	set
What:	new
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added selection and reified relation constraints with constant sets.

[ENTRY]
Module:	set
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Slightly stronger inferences for the finite set sequence and selection
constraints.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
New example: the balanced academic curriculum problem (problem 030 from
CSPlib).

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed the n-ary partition propagator to handle overflow of the sum of
cardinalities correctly.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Subscription to constant views now should use the propagate member function
from a variable implementation: it guarantees execution of a propagator at
least once (int and set views have been adopted accordingly).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	bug
Rank: 	major
Bug:	48
[DESCRIPTION]
Branching on maximum regret would always crash on non-range domains.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: 	change
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The finite set selection propagators accept an additional
argument that specifies where the indexing should start. It
should make some models more natural to express, and helps in
porting code from other systems, such as Prolog or Mozart.  In
addition, the selectUnion propagator is now hand-written again,
resulting in better performance.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
All Boolean constraints got a new and regular interface. Rather
than providing different post functions for the different
constraints, the single post function rel is used: the Boolean
operation then is described by a value of type BoolOpType. In
addition, all Boolean propagators have been reimplemented for
better performance and less memory use.

[ENTRY]
Module: test
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added simple testing for the branchings.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The way how propagators report subsumtion and partial fixpoints
has changed. Now, a propagator must first call dispose (which
then cancels subscriptions and possibly frees external resources)
and only then can return that the propagator is subsumed. For
that purpose a new function Gecode::ES_SUBSUMED has been
defined. Likewise, ES_FIX_PARTIAL and ES_NOFIX_PARTIAL are
functions rather than member functions of Gecode::Propagator. The
benefit is that this saves memory and is more efficient.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The use of the consistency options were a little confusing, now
the rule is: the level of constistency increases from ICL_VAL to
ICL_BND to ICL_DOM.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Boolean expressions errorneously decomposed into ternary Boolean
constraints, while not incorrect rather inefficient for large
Boolean expressions.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Made all macros type safe.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added macro GECODE_REWRITE for rewriting propagators. It is strongly advised
to always use this macro!

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   change
Rank:   minor
Bug:    46
[DESCRIPTION]
Orientation of Sudokus now match the orientation in the specification-file.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
New example: MineSweeper.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
New example: Domino.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Set projectors could subscribe with bogus propagation conditions.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Performance of the tell operations on finite set variables was improved. 
Especially the intersect operation benefits from this.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The element constraint now also supports integer values as result.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Add a generic class for assignments during search (similar to
generic branchings for views and values).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
All branching classes for value and view selection are now parametric.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Boolean variables cannot longer be initialized from an integer 
variable. If needed, a channel propagator must be posted (added).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The equality constraints have been replaced by a variant of rel.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The propagator abstractions Inhom* have been renamed to Mix*.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The operations t_one, t_one_none, t_zero, t_zero_none for Boolean
views have been renamed to one, one_none, zero, zero_none.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   performance
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Explicit disposal of actors has been reimplemented (the old
design was nothing but darn stupid). The memory overhead of
propagators is reduced by 40% for most propagators and 20% for
all. That is, a binary propagator takes 30% less memory and a
ternary propagator takes 25% less memory. Programs with many
binary or ternary propagators can run up to 20% faster.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Propagators and branchings that require disposal when a space is
deleted must now be explicitly registered via a force function
and explictly deregistered by an unforce function.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed memory leak in reified dom constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed memory leak in distinct constraint for sets.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
New example: PlacementPuzzle. The example uses
regular-constraints to place irregular-shaped pieces on a board.



[RELEASE]
Version:	1.3.1
Date:		2006-10-25
[DESCRIPTION]
This is a minor release which fixes a major bug (the first real
serious bug). Please update as soon as possible.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   bug
Rank:   major
Thanks: Rafael Meneses
[DESCRIPTION]
Branch&Bound search with ViewValBranchings (all standard branchings) together 
with batch recomputation was severely broken. The problems ranged from wrong 
search trees (missing solutions) to segmentation faults. The fix changes the 
way assigned variables are removed from the array in a ViewValBranching.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Bounds-consistent distinct catches border case when an assigned variable
during bounds propagation leads to value removal for value propagation.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Bounds-consistent distinct eliminates assigned variables more 
aggresively (can save up to 10% runtime in some cases).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks:	Alejandro Arbelaez
[DESCRIPTION]
IntVar::init now also raises exceptions for illegal domain specifications.





[RELEASE]
Version:	1.3.0
Date:		2006-09-19
[DESCRIPTION]
This release adds a compiler for finite set projectors and provides new
infrastructure making it easier to add new variable domains. In addition,
it contains recent bug fixes and minor improvements.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Compiler for finite set projectors. Given a specification of a finite set
constraint as a projector set, it generates C++ code for the corresponding
propagator. Together with the dynamic propagator for finite set projectors,
this implements the backend of the technique described in the paper
"Generating Propagators for Finite Set Constraints" (Tack, Schulte,
Smolka; CP 2006.).

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   new
Rank:   minor
Thanks:	Jorge Marques Pelizzoni
[DESCRIPTION]
Also pass options for linking standard libraries for MSVC.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The pkg-config files now contain the correct path if you configured to the
default prefix (i.e. /usr/local).

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added aliases lex, atleast, atmost, and exactly for the count constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Renamed lex constraint to rel (as it also supports equality and disequality).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Make count constraints with integer number of equal ocurrences
more incremental using dynamic subscriptions (gives a 20-30%
speedup).

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added an example for solving Black Hole patience games.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Subscription to variables now features an additional and optional
Boolean argument whether the propagator is to be processed. This
allows to dynamically create subscriptions during propagation.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   new
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
New configure switches: --enable-audit to include audit code, which may
contain expensive checks of internal invariants or alternative, checked
implementations of critical parts of Gecode. --enable-universal and 
--with-sdk, to support building universal binaries on Mac OS X.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:	new
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Variables can now be deallocated when the Space is deallocated (for example in 
case of failure). This is important in case a variable implementation needs to 
reference external resources. Deallocation can be switched on in the 
high-level description used for generating the variable implementation.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:	bug
Rank:	minor
Thanks:	Rafael Meneses
[DESCRIPTION]
Under certain conditions (posting in a failed space), the post function 
returned uninitialized variables.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	performance
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Variable implementations are now generated from a high-level
description (taking care of all aspects relating to modification
events and propagation conditions). While simplifying the
implementation of new variable domains considerably, this also can, 
in lucky cases, deliver a speed-up of 5%.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	performance
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Allocate subscriptions in separate memory area. Can speedup execution
in some (but few) cases by up to 15-20%.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	documentation
Rank: 	minor
Bug:	43
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed documentation problem due to doxygen...

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What: 	new
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branch-and-bound search now interleaves recomputation with adding
bounding constraints. This can prune the search tree much
earlier: instead of recomputing many nodes from the same copy
node and then adding a constraint that fails all these nodes, it
might be possible to already fail the copy node directly. In
principle, the difference can be exponential, however for
examples we tried the effect is minor.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Now commits can be interleaved with adding new constraints during
batch recomputation. This also entails that commit does not raise
an exception when applied to an already failed space (it is
simply ignored). The bug could not be observed (unless you did
some very fancy search engines yourself) and one could actually
see it as an extension.




[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.2
Date:		2006-07-25
[DESCRIPTION]
This release switches recomputation back on and removes some
experimental code that had sneaked into the system...

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	performance
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Some experimental code had sneaked into the release, slowing down
the system by more than 10%...

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What: 	bug
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
With the changes to search in Gecode 1.2.1 recomputation was
actually almost switched off...

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	performance
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Improve performance of domain-consistent distinct (by providing
special ternary version). Can reduce runtime by 10-20% for some
examples.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	performance
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Cut memory requirements for element (for integer arrays) by half.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added stress test for element constraint (originally due to Neng-Fa Zhou).

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added stress test for min constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added possibility to stop the search for solutions in examples based
on the time taken, the number of fails, or both.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added an example for solving Peacable co-existing armies of %Queens.



[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.1
Date:		2006-07-19
[DESCRIPTION]
In addition to the usual fixes and improvements, the biggest
change is that all branchings now must support branching
descriptions. This also entails straightforward changes
(simplifications) to search-related space operations and to the
implementation of search engines.


[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a macro GECODE_NEVER that assert that this command is never
executed.  This is preferred over assert(false) as it is used for
optimization, if supported by a compiler (for example, Microsoft
Visual C++).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection bug in n-ary min and max propagators.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Min and max propagators now correctly handle cases such as min(x,y)=x.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	removed
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Removed bounds-consistent propagation for count constraint (not worth
the trouble, just use domain-consistent).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	change
Rank: 	minor
Thanks:	Martin Mann
[DESCRIPTION]
The ViewValBranching class now passes the home space to all member
functions used in selecting the view and the value.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection for n-ary partition propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: 	new
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added finite set projection propagators. They allow to propagate all
finite set constraints expressible as finite set projectors, including
negated and reified constraints.

[ENTRY]
Module: support
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added simple class encapsulating a linear congruential pseudo-random
number generator.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The interface for branchings has changed considerably, reflecting
the fact now that all branchings must support branching descriptions.
This is also reflected in the Space::status operation which has its
arguments reversed and corrected const qualifiers on its arguments.
But the good news is that it is considerably simpler than before.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Assignment branchings (that is, branchings with a single alternative)
could possibly take the wrong values for assignment during recomputation.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The status operation does not any longer accept an argument for
the number of alternatives. The number of alternatives is now
available from a branching description (where it is passed upon
creation of the description). This reflects the fact that
branching descriptions are mandatory now.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a serious bug where during recomputation the search stack
was always inspected behind the last element: the reason why
recomputation never crashed has been that stacks always keep one
element extra for optimization. So, serious bug but looks as if
no one stumbled over this...

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
As Boolean variables can be derived from integer variables, the
assumption that a not yet assigned Boolean variable can not be
modified is wrong.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   documentation
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Generate one page per version released in changelog.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
Bug:	41
[DESCRIPTION]
Change exceptions thrown by Gecode to be compliant with C++
exceptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:	42
[DESCRIPTION]
Renamed macros so as to avoid nameclashes (all macros start with
GECODE_).

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Search engines now correctly count the number of propagation
steps including propagation that occurs when adaptive
recomputation creates additional clones.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branchings now must return branching descriptions and commit
operations also insist on being provided with branching
descriptions.  This change reflects that batch recomputation is
of vital importance for efficiency in Gecode.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Make Boolean linear constraints with constant right hand sides
more incremental using dynamic subscriptions (gives a 20-30% speedup).

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Take advantage of specialized Boolean propagators in Boolean
expressions and relations.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Made n-ary Boolean conjunction and disjunction more incremental by
using dynamic subscriptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Provide special versions of Boolean propagators optimizing cases
where n-ary disjunctions are true.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Change implementation of Boolean propagators from conjunction
to disjunction so that disjunction can be used as special case
for Boolean sum with inequalities.


[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.0
Date:		2006-06-20
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes quite some drastic changes to how propagators
and branchings are deleted: instead of using destructors they use
a dispose method that allows to pass a home space during deletion
(we will use this infrastructure measure to speed up cloning
considerably a little later). Moreover the directory structure
has changed on popular request so that all include files are to
be found in a gecode subdirectory. Apart from that, some small
fixes and extensions due to requests.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Cancelling subscriptions on views and variable implementations now
require also a home space (this has become possible due to not using
destructors but ordinary "dispose" member functions).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Actors (propagators and branchings) do not any longer use destructors
but a "dispose" member function that takes a home space as argument
and must return the size of the actor.
Important: this requires that dispose member functions from super-classes
and class members are called explicitly!

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.1.0
Date:		2006-04-10
[DESCRIPTION]
This minor release adds some new constraints (see below), adds support
for stopping search engines based on definable criterias, and some other
small fixes. Most notably, the test infrastructure has been extended to
also check whether propagators correctly claim that they have computed
a fixpoint (now all invariants a propagator must obey in Gecode are covered
by the test infrastructure). This has lead to many small fixes.
