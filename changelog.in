[RELEASE]
Version: 6.2.0
Date: 2019-04-12
[DESCRIPTION]
The release enables half-reification in FlatZinc, fixes
indeterminstic behavior for shared branching criteria, and fixes
several aspects for general tracers. It is recommended to upgrade
as soon as possible.

[ENTRY]
Module: flatzinc
What:   change
Rank:   minor
Thanks:	Jip J. Dekker
[DESCRIPTION]
Enable support for half-reified constraints in the Gecode MiniZinc
library. Half-reified constraints are used when a MiniZinc 
expression has to be reified and is detected to be in a positive
context. If no Half-reified constraint has been made available by
solver, the full reification will be used. Half-reifed constraints
in the MiniZinc solver library are declared in the same way as
reified constraints, but are appended by "_imp" instead of "_reif".

Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
For the combination of some constraints (min, max, nvalues, and
some constraints over Boolean variables) with shared variable
selection branching (that is, AFC, Action, and CHB) the behavior
of Gecode was indeterminstic. The indeterminism was based on
using memory addresses for determining the order of variables in
some propagators which in turn affected which propagator might
record failure first and hence influenced the branching decisions.

This major release fixes many bugs, adds quite some new

biggest change we ever did to %Gecode): the Boolean share argument
is not any longer needed (see how to change your programs in
\ref PageHowToChange_6 "How to Change to Gecode 6.0.0").  The added
functionality includes experimental support for the CPProfiler,
classes for lexicographic optimization (where the cost is defined

extensional constraints using tuple sets, and support for tracing
search engines.

[RELEASE]
Version: 5.1.0
Date: 2017-04-18
[DESCRIPTION]
This is a rather major release, fixing a number of bugs and
adding quite a number of new features. Some of the features
require changes to your models. 

In more detail: extended tracing so that all propagator
executions and commit operations can be traced; renamed activity
to action to avoid confusion with activity in SAT (and fixed that
action information is also recorded during failure); added CHB
(conflict-history based branching) heuristic; optimized AFC; all
functions taken as arguments by Gecode are now based on
std::function-types; instead of branching with INT_VAR_* and
INT_VAL_* for Boolean variables, BOOL_VAR_* and BOOL_VAL_* must
be used. There are a number of additional changes, so you might
want to read the whole changelog.

[RELEASE]
Version: 5.0.0
Date: 2016-10-25
[DESCRIPTION]
This release adds a number of new features and fixes many bugs
(some rather serious), so it is recommended to switch as soon as
possible to this release. Some highlights are: re-added limited
discrepancy search (LDS); added sequential and parallel
portfolio-based search (PBS); added support for groups of
propagators and branchers; added extensive tracing functionality
based on groups; propagators can be disabled and re-enabled;
support for arbitrary memory allocators; changed the notion of
"integer consistency level" to the more expressive concept
"integer propagation level".

It is recommended to read the new Chapter in MPG on groups and
tracing.

This release fixes some bugs and improves some search-related aspects.

Note that you will have to change all scripts that inherit from
the pre-defined script classes (Script, IntMinimizeScript,
IntMaximizeScript, FloatMinimizeScript, FloatMaximizeScript). The
change is easy: in your constructor you have to add a call to the
constructor of the pre-defined script class with the command line
options as argument. Just check any of the Gecode example for how
it is done.

Thanks:	Victor Zverovich, Tony Kelman
[DESCRIPTION]
Various fixes for CMake:
 - Set the output directory for runtime target files (executables and DLLs) to bin/ subdirectory of the project's binary directory to avoid collisions when Gecode is used as a subproject.Improve suppression of warnings.
 - Add GECODE_USE_QT variable which specifies whether to use Qt. Qt is used if GECODE_USE_QT is TRUE or unset.
 - Prevent linker warnings on MSVC.
 - Use per-target instead of global include directories. This simplifies use of Gecode as a subproject because add_target_libraries(<target> <gecode-lib>) now sets the necessary include directories for <target> in addition to link dependencies.
 - Fix to fully link internal dependencies needed for creating DLLs: https://github.com/ampl/gecode/pull/2

[RELEASE]
Version: 4.0.0
Date: 2013-03-14
[DESCRIPTION]
This release adds a multitude of new features, fixes many bugs,
and offers a number of performance improvements. There are too
many major improvements to even summarize them here all, so here
are just some highlights: LDSB as automatic symmetry breaking
during search; restart-based search; complete redesign and
reimplementation of branching enhancing the expressiveness
massively (AFC with decay, activity, user-defined variable and
value selection, tie-break control, better randomization, ...);
half-reification; addition of floating point constraints.

It is recommended to read the new Chapter in MPG on branching as
the changes are substantial and require you to change your
programs, see also the full list of changes below.

As the interfaces has changed, please consult \ref
PageHowToChange_4 "How to Change to Gecode 4.0.0".

That looks like an annoying change but is in fact essential: the
strategies using accumulated failure count and activity now could
have run into division by zero issues. And just changing the
implementation is not good enough because the values of these
measures can now be exposed during tie-breaking.

The entire infrastructure for variable-value branchers has been
reimplemented from scratch. The new design makes a much better
compromise between code size, efficiency, and expressiveness:
the efficiency is about the same (for examples with no
propagation and just branching one can note a slowdown of 2-4%)
while code size shrinks drastically (the overall code size for
integer variables shrinks by 20%) and the architecture is much
more expressive (in particular, it supports tie-break limits, see
MPG).

INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN becomes the function call INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN() and
INT_VAL_MIN_MIN becomes the function call INT_VAL_MIN_MIN(). Some
of these functions expect additional arguments and can take also
optional arguments (this replaces the VarBranchOptions and
ValBranchOptions). Please read the new "Branching" chapter

[RELEASE]

This release adds and improves quite a number of constraints
(total lexicographic order for set variables, membership
constraints for integer variables, counting constraints for
integer variables using integer sets, range, roots, set element
constraints for integer variables, number of values for integer
variables). All of these constraints (and some more) are now also
available in FlatZinc. Additionally, some fixes and improvements.

This release is an important milestone as %Gecode now provides
native implementations for all important constraints available
in MiniZinc/FlatZinc.

those constraints that are listed in the catalog).

This release adds new constraints (value precedence constraints

cleans up a number of existing constraints (scheduling,
channeling, relation, bin-packing, lexicographic relations), and
adds new functionality (support for externalization of choices
for distributed search, support for incremental propagation).

[RELEASE]
Version: 3.2.1
Date: 2009-11-04
[DESCRIPTION]
This release fixes one serious bug in the element constraint for
matrices; adds branchings using accumulated failure counts (also
known as weighted degree); provides some optimizations (mostly
for element constraints and for regular expressions with millions
of nodes); adds two cute models (word-square and crossword); and
a little this and that as always.

[DESCRIPTION]
Element constraints for integer arrays now accept shared integer
arrays (IntSharedArray). By this, the very same array can be
shared among several element constraints. Models require no
change, as IntArgs are automatically coerced to
IntSharedArrays. See "Modeling with Gecode" for more
explanation.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Propagators and variables now maintain an accumulated failure
count (AFC).
[MORE]
The AFC of a propagator counts how often has the propagator
failed during the entire search, and the AFC of a variable is its
degree plus the sum of the AFCs of all propagators depending on
the variable. While it looks straightforward, this required a
major extension of the Gecode kernel to deal with global
information accessed concurrently from several threads during
search. The AFC is also known as "weighted degree".

[DESCRIPTION]
Now posting of propagators and branchers take an object of class
Home (rather than just a space) that can carry additional
information relevant for posting (for example, groups and
accumulated failure information). Models do not need to be
changed in any way!
[MORE]
While models require no change, propagator rewriting does (it
will work but some information might be lost). Instead of writing
something like
GECODE_REWRITE(*this,SomeProp::post(home,...));
where *this is the propagator to be rewritten, you should now
write
GECODE_REWRITE(*this,SomeProp::post(home(*this),...));
By this, the new propagator will inherit information from *this
(in particular the accumulated failure count).


[RELEASE]
Version: 3.2.0
Date: 2009-10-05
[DESCRIPTION]
This release has some important bug fixes (in particular for
global cardinality aka count), the documentation has been
improved (worked around some issues with generation by doxygen),
integrates the FlatZinc interpreter into the Gecode source tree,
provides propagators for disjunctive scheduling (experimental),
and lots of small changes and fixes. For more consistent names,
branchings are branchers now and branching descriptions are
choices (this you might have to adapt to).

Parallel search is still experimental: creating and destroying a

[RELEASE]
Version: 3.0.0
Date: 2009-03-13
[DESCRIPTION]
This release is a major consolidation release: interfaces have
been cleaned up (consistent parameter passing, consistent naming,
simpler Gist interface, namespaces for operator overloading);
some functionality has been extended (propagators can be
non-monotonic; branchings support tie-breaking and random
variable and value selection); some functionality that did not
meet our quality goals has been removed (complete set variables,
reflection); usage has been simplified (auto-linking on Windows,
more commonly used filename extensions); important aspects have
been optimized (memory management, memory usage and efficiency on
64bit machines). These cleanups were in particular necessary to
make %Gecode easier to document (this release is the first to be
accompanied by tutorial documentation explaining how to model
with %Gecode).

Apart from that, many small fixes and additions. Please see below
for the details.

Introduced CopiedHandle as a new base class for SharedHandle. 
[MORE]
A copied handle provides access to an object that is used by
entities in a space, and that is copied when then space is
copied. This abstraction can be used e.g. to pass information
between different entities in a space, such as between
propagators and branchings.

An integer test can enable these new tests by setting the contest member
to CTL_BOUNDS_Z or CTL_BOUNDS_D. For domain-consistency propagators
the contest member is set automatically to CTL_DOMAIN. If no

Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
%Gecode now supports weakly monotonic propagators. 
[MORE]
A weakly monotonic propagator must only be able to decide for
assignments whether they are solutions or not (which is a very
natural property as it means the propagator must be a correct
implementation of a constraint). Otherwise, the propagator does
not have to be monotonic, it can even be indeterministic.

Weakly monotonic but not monotonic propagators must notify a
space about their existence: if a weakly monotonic propagator is
created, it must execute "home.notice(*this,AP_WEAKLY)"; if it is
disposed, it must execute "home.ignore(*this,AP_WEAKLY)".

Module: other
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Now everything is passed as reference (Space, Propagator,
ModEventDelta, Advisor, Branching, and BranchingDesc). 
[MORE]
The reason for this massive change is to be more C++ compliant
and make the interfaces more consistent (at some places things
were passed as references and at other places as pointers, for no
obvious and explainable reason). Routines that create objects
rather than pass them (such as copy, clone, or description) still
return a pointer to an object (so that it can actually be
deleted!).

You will have to rewrite your models and other programs using
%Gecode. For models this is easy enough:
 - Replace "(Space* home" by "(Space& home".
 - Replace "home->" by "home.".
 - Replace "(this" by "(*this".
 .
That should do the trick for 99% of the models.

For the other changes, just lookout for the changes in types and
that "this" becomes "*this" now.

The memory management has been completely reworked. 
[MORE]
It is now more robust, more portable (does not use alloca any
longer), more efficient, fits C++ better and is much easier too
understand. There are now three memory areas: a single heap,
spaces, and regions. Heap and spaces are as before. A region (an
object of class Region) is a simple and very efficient memory
manager for temporary memory managed in a stack fashion. These
three memory managers provide uniform operations for allocation
(alloc), deallocation (free), and reallocation (realloc). These
operations use constructors, destructors, and assignment
operators as required by C++ and are implemented with efficient
specializations for basic data types.

This release makes two essential contributions: a partly
reimplemented kernel that is faster, is simpler, and uses less
memory and lots of small and not so small fixes. This release is
the first release where really everything that we can test
(rather than everything that we initially believed to matter) has
been systematically tested. So, better switch now to 2.1.0!

Apart from that, the value range for variables has been increased
(basically, 32 bits minus three values, so that is 32 bits), the reflection 
API is now fully functional and no longer considered experimental, and we have
the usual small additions.

the static function View::me with the passed
modification event delta. Again, this feature committed the kernel to a
particular implementation which might not be available in the
future.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The kernel has undergone some cleanups and improvements (much of
it got actually reimplemented):
 - Automatically generated stubs for variable implementations are directly
   inlined into the kernel. This improves performance, but more
   importantly, lifts some limits on the number of variables. Now, the
   only limit is that the sum of the ceiling of the logarithms of the 
   number of modification events of all variables does not exceed 32
   (as an estimate, the kernel now can handle around 10 to 16 variable
   types). Moreover, if the need for more variable types arises this is 
   straightforward to do.
 - The addition of new variable types for users has been simplified.
 - The main propagation loop has been entirely rewritten (much much simpler).
   Now, the kernel does not optimize any longer for the case that a
   variable is modified more than once during propagator execution.
   While this changes the asymptotic complexity, it reduces the propagator
   execution overhead by up to 30%. And a propagator is still free
   to make sure that a variable is modified only once (many propagators
   do that already).
 - Variable implementations became smaller by one word. Now variable
   implementations are optimal in the sense that no additional memory
   is needed for cloning or book-keeping, the memory required for 
   propagation is sufficient.
 - Spaces have lost some weight as memory for datastructures only used
   during cloning or propagation are shared (saves some 25% of memory
   per space).

[RELEASE]
Version: 2.0.0
Date:    2007-11-14
[DESCRIPTION]
As witnessed by the version number change, this is a major
release with too many changes, fixes, and additions to mention
them all: please consult the changelog.

The highlights are:
 - New propagators: channeling between Integer variable and array
   of Boolean variables, circuit, table constraint (extensional),
   incremental regular constraint (extensional), incremental
   Boolean linear constraints
 - Boolean variables have a dedicated implementation: twice as
   fast, half the memory
 - Advisors for incremental propagation (see: Lagerkvist,
   Schulte, Advisors for Incremental Propagation, CP 2007)
 - Many crucial performance and scalability improvements: memory
   management, memory footprint of propagators
 - Many cleanups and more documentation, many new examples
 - New set variables with complete domain representation
   (CpltSetVar) [experimental]
 - A reflection API to query spaces about their propagators
   [experimental]

The features marked as experimental are all functional, but might
be revised in the next releases.
 
As %Gecode 2.0.0 is a major release, you might have to adapt your
programs:  \ref PageHowToChange_2 "How to Change to Gecode 2.0.0".

The memory management policies have been completely reworked. Now
memory requests are much more regular. Hence, memory is much more
likely to be returned to the operating system. Furthermore, the
flush member functions for actors have been removed (they were
unneeded) and actors and spaces now have allocated member
functions for returning how much memory is allocated by a space.

Moreover, the memory reported by some propagators has been
ignored. Note that this flaw did not affect the benchmark figures

Boolean variables (and hence Boolean views) do not any longer
share the implementation with integer variables. That has the

- Boolean variables are not any longer integer variables. The same
  holds true for arrays of variables.
- All constraints that make sense for both Boolean and integer
  variables have post functions that support both integer and

[DESCRIPTION]
The finite set selection propagators accept an additional
argument that specifies where the indexing should start. It
should make some models more natural to express, and helps in
porting code from other systems, such as Prolog or Mozart.  In
addition, the selectUnion propagator is now hand-written again,
resulting in better performance.

[DESCRIPTION]
All Boolean constraints got a new and regular interface. Rather
than providing different post functions for the different

addition, all Boolean propagators have been reimplemented for
better performance and less memory use.

The way how propagators report subsumption and partial fixpoints
has changed. Now, a propagator must first call dispose (which
then cancels subscriptions and possibly frees external resources)
and only then can return that the propagator is subsumed. For
that purpose a new function Gecode::ES_SUBSUMED has been
defined. Likewise, ES_FIX_PARTIAL and ES_NOFIX_PARTIAL are
functions rather than member functions of Gecode::Propagator. The
benefit is that this saves memory and is more efficient.

Explicit disposal of actors has been reimplemented (the old
design was nothing but darn stupid). The memory overhead of
propagators is reduced by 40% for most propagators and 20% for
all. That is, a binary propagator takes 30% less memory and a
ternary propagator takes 25% less memory. Programs with many
binary or ternary propagators can run up to 20% faster.

Variables can now be deallocated when the Space is deallocated (for example in 
case of failure). This is important in case a variable implementation needs to 
reference external resources. Deallocation can be switched on in the

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What: 	new
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branch-and-bound search now interleaves recomputation with adding
bounding constraints. This can prune the search tree much
earlier: instead of recomputing many nodes from the same copy
node and then adding a constraint that fails all these nodes, it
might be possible to already fail the copy node directly. In
principle, the difference can be exponential, however for
examples we tried the effect is minor.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Now commits can be interleaved with adding new constraints during
batch recomputation. This also entails that commit does not raise
an exception when applied to an already failed space (it is
simply ignored). The bug could not be observed (unless you did
some very fancy search engines yourself) and one could actually
see it as an extension.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.1
Date:		2006-07-19
[DESCRIPTION]
In addition to the usual fixes and improvements, the biggest

descriptions. This also entails straightforward changes
(simplifications) to search-related space operations and to the
implementation of search engines.

[DESCRIPTION]
The interface for branchings has changed considerably, reflecting
the fact now that all branchings must support branching descriptions.
This is also reflected in the Space::status operation which has its
arguments reversed and corrected const qualifiers on its arguments.
But the good news is that it is considerably simpler than before.

Assignment branchings (that is, branchings with a single alternative)
could possibly take the wrong values for assignment during recomputation.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The status operation does not any longer accept an argument for
the number of alternatives. The number of alternatives is now
available from a branching description (where it is passed upon
creation of the description). This reflects the fact that
branching descriptions are mandatory now.

[ENTRY]
Module: search

was always inspected behind the last element: the reason why
recomputation never crashed has been that stacks always keep one
element extra for optimization. So, serious bug but looks as if
no one stumbled over this...

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.0
Date:		2006-06-20
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes quite some drastic changes to how propagators
and branchings are deleted: instead of using destructors they use
a dispose method that allows passing a home space during deletion
(we will use this infrastructure measure to speed up cloning
considerably a little later). Moreover the directory structure
has changed on popular request so that all include files are to
be found in a gecode subdirectory. Apart from that, some small
fixes and extensions due to requests.

Actors (propagators and branchings) do not any longer use destructors

small fixes. Most notably, the test infrastructure has been extended to
also check whether propagators correctly claim that they have computed
a fixpoint (now all invariants a propagator must obey in %Gecode are covered
by the test infrastructure). This has lead to many small fixes.
