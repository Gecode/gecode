[RELEASE]
Version: 3.x
Date: 2008-
[DESCRIPTION]
This is a release.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Jonathan Cederberg
[DESCRIPTION]
The binary min and max propagators did not do all pruning it
should do.
[MORE]
Given the constraint x = max(y,z) with the store {x->{1,2,3},
y->{1,2}, z->{3}}, propagation did not yield any new information
(now it gives the correct result {x->{3}, y->{1,2}, z->{3}}).


[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
New example: the steel mill slab design problem (Problem 38 in <a
href="http://csplib.org">CSPLib</a>).
[MORE]
The model used is from Gargani and Refalo, "An efficient model and
strategy for the steel mill slab design problem.", CP 2007. The
symmetry-breaking search is from Van Hentenryck and Michel, "The Steel
Mill Slab Design Problem Revisited", CPAIOR 2008.


[ENTRY]
Module: iter
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Stefano Gualandi
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed init method of SingletonAppend range iterator.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a bug in the extensional propagation-version of the domino example.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
For the Microsoft compiler, auto-link information is added during
compilation. That is, by including Gecode headers during
compilation the right libraries will be found automatically
during linking. To simplify development and deployment, the
libraries (and DLLs) encode version, platform, and build type
(release or debug) in their filename.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Posting constraints according to Boolean expressions now uses a
negation normalform and by this avoids any propagator for
negation and uses fewer propagators due to the new clause constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Decomposition during search (DDS) has been added as a new search engine. DDS 
is an implementation of And/Or search. It tries to decompose the problem into 
independent subproblems, potentially reducing the search space dramatically. 

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Changed naming scheme: All files with extension .cc have been renamed to .cpp, 
and .icc has become .hpp. This avoids conflicts as .icc is typically used for 
other file types. All include directives are now specified using <...>
notation instead of "...", so that Gecode headers do not clutter the include
namespace of a client program.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The Matrix class is now in the Gecode namespace (and not in
Gecode::MiniModel).

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Reorganized the internal data structures of set variables so that each 
variable takes up 8 bytes less memory on 64 bit machines.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The index structure for variable dependencies is now implemented using ints
instead of pointers, saving memory on 64 bit machines. For example, the index 
structure of integer variables is now 40% smaller, for Boolean variables 
(which have the smallest possible index structure) we still save 16%.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a Boolean clause constraint that supports conjunction and
disjunction of both positive and negative variables.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Now n-ary Boolean disjunction and conjunction are constant time
(rather than linear time, as before), even when a variable for
the result is used.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Gecode now supports weakly monotonic propagators. A weakly monotonic
propagator must only be able to decide for assignments wether they are
solutions or not (which is a very natural property as it means the
propagator must be a correct implementation of a
constraint). Otherwise, the propagator does not have to be monotonic,
it can even be indeterministic.

Weakly monotonic but not monotonic propagators must notify a
space about their existence: if a weakly monotonic propagator is
created, it must execute "home.notice(*this,AP_WEAKLY)"; if it is
disposed, it must execute "home.ignore(*this,AP_WEAKLY)".

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The functions force and unforce of an actor to force disposal
have been removed. Now, the new interface based on notice and
ignore using actor properties must be used instead. So, instead
of "force(home)", write "home.notice(*this,AP_DISPOSE)" and,
instead of "unforce(home)", write
"home.ignore(*this,AP_DISPOSE)".

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The incremental extensional propagator for tuplesets uses less
memory (around 25%) and reports its size correctly.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The element propagator for integer arrays now chooses
datastructures according to and the elements of the array. This
can save more than 80% memory on a 64 bit machine, and up to 75%
on a 32 bit machine. In common cases, one can expect a reduction by
at least 50%.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The regular propagator now chooses datastructures according to
the size of the DFA. This can save up to 80% memory on a 64 bit
machine, and still up to 50% on a 32 bit machine.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The home space is now also passed to the cost function of a propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Now everything is passed as reference (Space, Propagator,
ModEventDelta, Advisor, Branching, and BranchingDesc). The reason
for this massive change is to be more C++ and make it consistent
(at some places things were passed as references and at other
places as pointers, for no obvious and explainable
reason). Routines that create objects rather than pass them (such
as copy, clone, or description) still return a pointer to an
object (so that it can actually be deleted!).

You will have to rewrite your models and other programs using
Gecode. For models this is easy enough:
 - Replace "(Space* home" by "(Space& home".
 - Replace "home->" by "home.".
 - Replace "(this" by "(*this".
 .
That should do the trick for 99% of the models.

For the other changes, just lookout for the changes in types and
that "this" becomes "*this" now.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The memory management has been completely reworked. It is now
more robust, more portable (does not use alloca any longer), more
efficient, fits C++ better and is much easier too
understand. There are now three memory areas: a single heap,
spaces, and regions. Heap and spaces are as before. A region
(an object of class Region) is a simple and very efficient
memory manager for temporary memory managed in a stack
fashion. These three memory managers provide uniform operations
for allocation (alloc), deallocation (free), and reallocation
(realloc). These operations use constructors, destructors, and
assignment operators as required by C++ and are implemented with
efficient specializations for basic data types.

[ENTRY]
Module: support
What:   removed
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
PQueue has been removed (too specialized to be reused anyway).

[ENTRY]
Module: support

Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
GECODE_AUTOARRAY has been removed. Use a Region for memory
management instead.

[ENTRY]
Module: support

StaticStack instead.

[ENTRY]
Module: int

Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]

propagators (integer arrays).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
All functions for checking sharing for arrays (same, shared,
unique) require a space argument (for memory management).

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added MinimizeSpace and MaximizeSpace classes for cost-based
optimization (requires implementing a cost function returning an
integer cost variable). Optimization can now be implemented by
inheriting from these classes rather than from Space and by
implementing a cost function.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The description() member function of a space is not any longer
const: it can be called at most once.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The constrain method used for best solution search must be
virtual and takes an argument of type const Space& rather than
Space* as argument.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Tie-breaking and random selection for branch is now supported.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The values for variable and value selection for branching have
been made consistent and extended. 
[MORE]
The following values have been renamed:
 - SET_VAR_MIN_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MIN
 - SET_VAR_MAX_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MAX
 - SET_VAR_MIN_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MIN_MIN
 - SET_VAR_MAX_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MAX_MAX
 - SET_VAL_MIN -> SET_VAL_MIN_INC
 - SET_VAL_MAX -> SET_VAL_MAX_INC
 .
Tie-breaking and random selection is now supported.

[ENTRY]
Module: cpltset
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The values for variable and value selection for branching have
been made consistent and extended. 
[MORE]
The following values have 
been renamed:
 - CPLTSET_VAR_MIN_CARD -> CPLTSET_VAR_SIZE_MIN
 - CPLTSET_VAR_MAX_CARD -> CPLTSET_VAR_SIZE_MAX
 - CPLTSET_VAR_MIN_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> CPLTSET_VAR_MIN_MIN
 - CPLTSET_VAR_MAX_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> CPLTSET_VAR_MAX_MAX
 - CPLTSET_VAL_MIN_UNKNOWN -> CPLTSET_VAL_MIN_INC
 - CPLTSET_VAL_MAX_UNKNOWN -> CPLTSET_VAL_MAX_INC
 - CPLTSET_VAL_MIN_UNKNOWN_EX_FIRST -> CPLTSET_VAL_MIN_EXC
 - CPLTSET_VAL_MAX_UNKNOWN_EX_FIRST -> CPLTSET_VAL_MAX_EXC
 .
Tie-breaking and random selection is now supported.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The variable selection INT_VAR_DEGREE_MIN and INT_VAR_DEGREE_MAX
do not have tiebreaking with smallest domain size built in. The old
behaviour can be reclaimed by explicit tiebreaking, for example
replace INT_VAR_DEGREE_MAX by
tiebreak(INT_VAR_DEGREE_MAX,INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
View and value branchings have been completely reimplemented to support
tie-breaking and state (for randomized selection).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   removed
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
View and value assignments have been removed as they now can be
expressed by view and value branchings.

[RELEASE]
Version: 2.2.0
Date: 2008-08-25
[DESCRIPTION]
This release adds many domain consistent propagators for
arithmetic constraints and fixes a number of bugs. Some of these
bugs fixed are potentially serious, in particular as they occur
very seldom. Please change to 2.2.0 as soon as possible (in
particular if you are using the 64bit Microsoft Visual C++
compiler). And, of course, the usual small fixes and changes.

Made the constructor of Reflection::Var explicit, otherwise overloading for
output stream operators does not work as expected.


[RELEASE]
Version: 2.1.0
Date:    2008-02-29
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes two essential contributions: a partly
reimplemented kernel that is faster, is simpler, and uses less
memory and lots of small and not so small fixes. This release is
the first release where really everything that we can test
(rather than everything that we initially believed to matter) has
been systematically tested. So, better switch now to 2.1.0!

Apart from that, the value range for variables has been increased
(basically, 32 bits minus three values, so that is 32 bits), the reflection 
API is now fully functional and no longer considered experimental, and we have
the usual small additions.

[DESCRIPTION]
The serialization library now contains a registry of all the Gecode post 
functions. This makes interfacing to Gecode much easier. The registry is 
automatically generated from the post functions defined in gecode/int.hh and 
gecode/set.hh.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Cleaned up reflection. Unreflection is now part of the kernel instead of the 
serialization library. Branchings now provide a human-readable description of 
a BranchingDesc. The name function of a Propagator has been renamed to ati 
(actor type identifier). All reflection is now const where possible. 
Unreflection of variables now checks dynamically that the variable types 
match. Unreflection of propagators checks the number of arguments. A 
tutorial-style section on reflection has been added to the documentation.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The limits for set variables have been moved from Limits::Set to
Set::Limits.

The range of set variables has been adapted to the range of
integer variables.  For example, on a standard machine
(regardless of 32 or 64 bits), a set can hold values from -2^30+2
to 2^30-2, its maximum cardinality therefore is 2^31-3.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The limits for set variables have been moved from Limits::Set to
Set::Limits.

The range of integer variables have been extended by one bit. For
example, on a standard machine (regardless of 32 or 64 bits), the
largest possible integer value for an integer variable is 2^31-2,
the smallest -2^31+2. With other words, only the integer values
2^31-1, -2^31, and -2^31+1 are missing from the two-complement
representation (and we will never use these values for the sake
of mental sanity. We promise.).

[ENTRY]

Distinct with integer offsets checks accurately for overflow now.

Boolean variables consume 20% less memory.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Only stable and non-failed spaces can be cloned, otherwise
Space::clone raises an exception. This makes cloning and
propagation fully orthogonal. To emulate the old behavior, just
execute Space::status before Space::clone.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The number of propagators and branchings can be accurately
retrieved from both failed and non-stable spaces.

[ENTRY]
Module: examples
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added an example that interprets a JavaScript program and runs a search of the 
model that the program encodes. This is an example of how to use the 
JavaScript interpreter. A simple JavaScript model for n-Queens has been added, 
too.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
A generic variable class has been added that can be used for interfacing. It 
can store arbitrary Gecode variables (e.g. IntVar and SetVar), and cast them

Both the cost and propagate function of a propagator take the
current modification event delta as input. Likewise,
retrieving the modification event for a particular View must use
the static function View::me with the passed
modification event delta. Again, this feature committed the kernel to a
particular implementation which might not be available in the
future.

Simple Singleton Arc Consistency pre-processing has been added as an

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The kernel has undergone some cleanups and improvements (much of
it got actually reimplemented):
 - Automatically generated stubs for variable implementations are directly
   inlined into the kernel. This improves performance, but more
   importantly, lifts some limits on the number of variables. Now, the
   only limit is that the sum of the ceiling of the logarithms of the 
   number of modification events of all variables does not exceed 32
   (as an estimate, the kernel now can handle around 10 to 16 variable
   types). Moreover, if the need for more variable types arises this is 
   straightforward to do.
 - The addition of new variable types for users has been simplified.
 - The main propagation loop has been entirely rewritten (much much simpler).
   Now, the kernel does not optimize any longer for the case that a
   variable is modified more than once during propagator execution.
   While this changes the asymptotic complexity, it reduces the propagator
   execution overhead by up to 30%. And a propagator is still free
   to make sure that a variable is modified only once (many propagators
   do that already).
 - Variable implementations became smaller by one word. Now variable
   implementations are optimal in the sense that no additional memory
   is needed for cloning or book-keeping, the memory required for 
   propagation is sufficient.
 - Spaces have lost some weight as memory for datastructures only used
   during cloning or propagation are shared (saves some 25% of memory
   per space).

[RELEASE]
Version: 2.0.0
Date:    2007-11-14
[DESCRIPTION]
As witnessed by the version number change, this is a major
release with too many changes, fixes, and additions to mention
them all: please consult the changelog.

The highlights are:
 - New propagators: channeling between Integer variable and array
   of Boolean variables, circuit, table constraint (extensional),
   incremental regular constraint (extensional), incremental
   Boolean linear constraints
 - Boolean variables have a dedicated implementation: twice as
   fast, half the memory
 - Advisors for incremental propagation (see: Lagerkvist,
   Schulte, Advisors for Incremental Propagation, CP 2007)
 - Many crucial performance and scalability improvements: memory
   management, memory footprint of propagators
 - Many cleanups and more documentation, many new examples
 - New set variables with complete domain representation
   (CpltSetVar) [experimental]
 - A reflection API to query spaces about their propagators
   [experimental]

The features marked as experimental are all functional, but might
be revised in the next releases.
 
As %Gecode 2.0.0 is a major release, you might have to adapt your
programs:  \ref PageHowToChange_2 "How to Change to Gecode 2.0.0".

The memory management policies have been completely reworked. Now
memory requests are much more regular. Hence, memory is much more

functions for returning how much memory is allocated by a space.

Moreover, the memory reported by some propagators has been

- Boolean variables are not any longer integer variables. The same

The finite set selection propagators accept an additional
argument that specifies where the indexing should start. It
should make some models more natural to express, and helps in

addition, the selectUnion propagator is now hand-written again,
resulting in better performance.

All Boolean constraints got a new and regular interface. Rather
than providing different post functions for the different

The way how propagators report subsumption and partial fixpoints

then cancels subscriptions and possibly frees external resources)
and only then can return that the propagator is subsumed. For
that purpose a new function Gecode::ES_SUBSUMED has been
defined. Likewise, ES_FIX_PARTIAL and ES_NOFIX_PARTIAL are
functions rather than member functions of Gecode::Propagator. The
benefit is that this saves memory and is more efficient.

Explicit disposal of actors has been reimplemented (the old
design was nothing but darn stupid). The memory overhead of
propagators is reduced by 40% for most propagators and 20% for

Variables can now be deallocated when the Space is deallocated (for example in 
case of failure). This is important in case a variable implementation needs to 
reference external resources. Deallocation can be switched on in the

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What: 	new
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branch-and-bound search now interleaves recomputation with adding
bounding constraints. This can prune the search tree much
earlier: instead of recomputing many nodes from the same copy
node and then adding a constraint that fails all these nodes, it
might be possible to already fail the copy node directly. In
principle, the difference can be exponential, however for
examples we tried the effect is minor.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Now commits can be interleaved with adding new constraints during
batch recomputation. This also entails that commit does not raise
an exception when applied to an already failed space (it is
simply ignored). The bug could not be observed (unless you did
some very fancy search engines yourself) and one could actually
see it as an extension.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.1
Date:		2006-07-19
[DESCRIPTION]
In addition to the usual fixes and improvements, the biggest
change is that all branchings now must support branching
descriptions. This also entails straightforward changes
(simplifications) to search-related space operations and to the
implementation of search engines.


[ENTRY]

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The interface for branchings has changed considerably, reflecting
the fact now that all branchings must support branching descriptions.
This is also reflected in the Space::status operation which has its
arguments reversed and corrected const qualifiers on its arguments.
But the good news is that it is considerably simpler than before.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug

[DESCRIPTION]
Assignment branchings (that is, branchings with a single alternative)
could possibly take the wrong values for assignment during recomputation.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The status operation does not any longer accept an argument for
the number of alternatives. The number of alternatives is now
available from a branching description (where it is passed upon
creation of the description). This reflects the fact that
branching descriptions are mandatory now.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a serious bug where during recomputation the search stack
was always inspected behind the last element: the reason why
recomputation never crashed has been that stacks always keep one
element extra for optimization. So, serious bug but looks as if
no one stumbled over this...

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.0
Date:		2006-06-20
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes quite some drastic changes to how propagators
and branchings are deleted: instead of using destructors they use
a dispose method that allows passing a home space during deletion
(we will use this infrastructure measure to speed up cloning
considerably a little later). Moreover the directory structure
has changed on popular request so that all include files are to
be found in a gecode subdirectory. Apart from that, some small
fixes and extensions due to requests.

Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Actors (propagators and branchings) do not any longer use destructors
but a "dispose" member function that takes a home space as argument

and class members are called explicitly!

This minor release adds some new constraints (see below), adds support

small fixes. Most notably, the test infrastructure has been extended to
also check whether propagators correctly claim that they have computed
a fixpoint (now all invariants a propagator must obey in %Gecode are covered
by the test infrastructure). This has lead to many small fixes.
