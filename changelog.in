[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.2
Date:		2006-07-25
[DESCRIPTION]
This release switches recomputation back on and removes some
experimental code that had sneaked into the system...

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	performance
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Some experimental code had sneaked into the release, slowing down
the system by more than 10%...

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What: 	bug
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
With the changes to search in Gecode 1.2.1 recomputation was
actually almost switched off...

Added an example for solving Peacable co-existing armies of %Queens.



[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.1
Date:		2006-07-19
[DESCRIPTION]
In addition to the usual fixes and improvements, the biggest
change is that all branchings now must support branching
descriptions. This also entails straightforward changes
(simplifications) to search-related space operations and to the
implementation of search engines.


[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	new
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a macro GECODE_NEVER that assert that this command is never
executed.  This is preferred over assert(false) as it is used for
optimization, if supported by a compiler (for example, Microsoft
Visual C++).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection bug in n-ary min and max propagators.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Min and max propagators now correctly handle cases such as min(x,y)=x.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	removed
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Removed bounds-consistent propagation for count constraint (not worth
the trouble, just use domain-consistent).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What: 	change
Rank: 	minor
Thanks:	Martin Mann
[DESCRIPTION]
The ViewValBranching class now passes the home space to all member
functions used in selecting the view and the value.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: 	bug
Rank: 	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection for n-ary partition propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: 	new
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added finite set projection propagators. They allow to propagate all
finite set constraints expressible as finite set projectors, including
negated and reified constraints.

[ENTRY]
Module: support
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added simple class encapsulating a linear congruential pseudo-random
number generator.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The interface for branchings has changed considerably, reflecting
the fact now that all branchings must support branching descriptions.
This is also reflected in the Space::status operation which has its
arguments reversed and corrected const qualifiers on its arguments.
But the good news is that it is considerably simpler than before.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Assignment branchings (that is, branchings with a single alternative)
could possibly take the wrong values for assignment during recomputation.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
The status operation does not any longer accept an argument for
the number of alternatives. The number of alternatives is now
available from a branching description (where it is passed upon
creation of the description). This reflects the fact that
branching descriptions are mandatory now.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a serious bug where during recomputation the search stack
was always inspected behind the last element: the reason why
recomputation never crashed has been that stacks always keep one
element extra for optimization. So, serious bug but looks as if
no one stumbled over this...

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
As Boolean variables can be derived from integer variables, the
assumption that a not yet assigned Boolean variable can not be
modified is wrong.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   documentation
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Generate one page per version released in changelog.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
Bug:	41
[DESCRIPTION]
Change exceptions thrown by Gecode to be compliant with C++
exceptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:	42
[DESCRIPTION]
Renamed macros so as to avoid nameclashes (all macros start with
GECODE_).

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Search engines now correctly count the number of propagation
steps including propagation that occurs when adaptive
recomputation creates additional clones.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Branchings now must return branching descriptions and commit
operations also insist on being provided with branching
descriptions.  This change reflects that batch recomputation is
of vital importance for efficiency in Gecode.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Make Boolean linear constraints with constant right hand sides
more incremental using dynamic subscriptions (gives a 20-30% speedup).

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Take advantage of specialized Boolean propagators in Boolean
expressions and relations.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Made n-ary Boolean conjunction and disjunction more incremental by
using dynamic subscriptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Provide special versions of Boolean propagators optimizing cases
where n-ary disjunctions are true.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Change implementation of Boolean propagators from conjunction
to disjunction so that disjunction can be used as special case
for Boolean sum with inequalities.


[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.0
Date:		2006-06-20
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes quite some drastic changes to how propagators
and branchings are deleted: instead of using destructors they use
a dispose method that allows to pass a home space during deletion
(we will use this infrastructure measure to speed up cloning
considerably a little later). Moreover the directory structure
has changed on popular request so that all include files are to
be found in a gecode subdirectory. Apart from that, some small
fixes and extensions due to requests.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Luis Otero
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed memory leak in finite set distinct propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed memory leak in global cardinality constraint.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Martin Mann
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed bug in equality tests that could lead to reified (dis)equality
propagators not achieving domain consistency.

[ENTRY]
Module: test
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added --enable-leak-debug configure option. This option causes the test suite
to call mtrace() under Linux, which can be used to test for memory leaks.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
More aggresive inlining for cancelling subscriptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:	39
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed linkage of BAB destructor under Cygwin.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The branch member function for branchings now also takes a home space
as argument.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Cancelling subscriptions on views and variable implementations now
require also a home space (this has become possible due to not using
destructors but ordinary "dispose" member functions).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Actors (propagators and branchings) do not any longer use destructors
but a "dispose" member function that takes a home space as argument
and must return the size of the actor.
Important: this requires that dispose member functions from super-classes
and class members are called explicitly!
	
[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Spaces can be queried for number of propagators and branchings.
	
[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   new

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   change
Rank:   major
Thanks:	Martin Mann
[DESCRIPTION]
Moved library source code into gecode subdirectory. Facilitates cleaner
installation. Programs compiling against Gecode now need to include
e.g. "gecode/int.hh".
	
[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Sudoku example generalized to arbitrarily sized Sudokus.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.1.0
Date:		2006-04-10
[DESCRIPTION]
This minor release adds some new constraints (see below), adds support
for stopping search engines based on definable criterias, and some other
small fixes. Most notably, the test infrastructure has been extended to
also check whether propagators correctly claim that they have computed
a fixpoint (now all invariants a propagator must obey in Gecode are covered
by the test infrastructure). This has lead to many small fixes.
	
[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Bug:    37
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Kari Pahula
[DESCRIPTION]
Added a configure switch --enable-doc-dot. If enabled, this checks for

Global cardinality changed to non-staged version.  Further
inference for cardinality variables added.  Parts of the graph
structure for the domain-consistent propagator have been revised
so as to avoid unnecessary propagation in case of fixed
